-- 5) Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
-- For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"

-- 6) What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?
